=== Newsyslog

Native to macOS, link:https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?newsyslog.conf(5)[newsyslog] can be used
to configure system-wide log rotation across multiple projects. It’s a good recommendation to set
this up so that disk space is carefully maintained. Here’s how to configure it for your system,
start by creating a configuration for your projects in the `+/etc/newsyslog.d+` directory. In my
case, I use the following configurations:

* `+/etc/newsyslog.d/alchemists.conf+`
+
....
  # logfilename                                            [owner:group]    mode   count   size  when  flags
  /Users/bkuhlmann/Dropbox/Development/Work/**/log/*.log                    644    2       5120  *     GJN
....
* `+/etc/newsyslog.d/homebrew.conf+`
+
....
  # logfilename                   [owner:group]    mode   count   size    when  flags
  /usr/local/var/log/**/*.log                      644    2       5120    *     GJN
....

These configurations ensure that logs are rotated every 5MB (5120KB). In order to test that these
configurations are valid, run:

....
sudo newsyslog -nvv
....

If you don’t see any errors in the output, then your configuration settings are correct.

The last thing to do is to add a launch configuration to ensure the log rotations happen at
regularly scheduled intervals. To do this create the following file:
`+$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.newsyslog.plist+`. It should have the following content:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "https://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>com.apple.newsyslog</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/sbin/newsyslog</string>
  </array>
  <key>LowPriorityIO</key>
  <true/>
  <key>Nice</key>
  <integer>1</integer>
  <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
  <dict>
    <key>Minute</key>
    <integer>30</integer>
  </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
----

That’s it. System-wide log rotation is setup for your projects.

=== Customization

While this project’s configuration is opinionated and tailored for my setup, you can easily fork
this project and customize it for your environment. Start by editing the files found in the `+bin+`
and `+lib+` directories. Check out the
link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/mac_os/#_customization[macOS Customization Documentation]
for further details.

_TIP_: The installer determines which applications/extensions to install as defined in the
`+settings.sh+` script. Applications defined with the "`APP_NAME`" suffix and extensions defined
with the "`EXTENSION_PATH`" suffix inform the installer what to care about. Removing/commenting out
these applications/extensions within the `+settings.sh+` file will cause the installer to skip these
applications/extensions.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os-config.git
cd mac_os-config
----
